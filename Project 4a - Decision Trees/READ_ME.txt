Extra Credit Dataset: iris_rounded.txt (found in the provided datasets foler)

Details about Dataset: I downloaded this dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and modified it so that the values for the attributes would be discrete numbers (using python's round method). I believe this is a reasonable change to the dataset and does not decrease the complexity of the extra credit assignment.
