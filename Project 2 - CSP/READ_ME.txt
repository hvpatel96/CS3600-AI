Hey! I included this READ_ME just to make sure you guys don't have trouble when grading my project. There are four things in this directory that I have edited:

1. BinaryCSP.py - Where I coded all of the algorithms/heuristics and have added my own custom binary constraints for the extra credit
2. autograder.py - I simply changed the dictionary "questionValues" so that the autograder would also run my extra credit CSP problem
3. Extra - a directory that has my extra credit CSP problem (with the .csp, .solution, and .test files; I did not include a .assignment file because I do not want any initial assignments)
4. CompleteProject2WithAutograderModifiedToIncludeExtraCredit - a directory that has all of the changes I made to the original Project2 directory provided including the edits made in BinaryCSP.py, autograder.py, the test_cases directory, and the csps directory. Simply run autograder.py in this directory and the results of all tests should be displayed.

Thanks!
